# PandEdit TODO

- Proper right align of text
- Can go down one line too many (using arrow keys)
- std::string_view
- Abc::Abc, the second Abc should be highlighted
- Pointers and reference tokens should not affect highlighting
	- Abc& abc is not highlighted due to the ampersand
- Comments in the middle of things ruin it
